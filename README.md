# msprime-abc
Demographic inference and more, using msprime and simuPOP

# Known Issues:
* No mutations
* Fixed population size per generation
* Limited to single randomly-mating population
* Genotypes saved for all individuals in the forward simulations, rather than coalescent nodes only
* Raw text file output by simuPOP not cleaned up after writing data in hdf5 format
